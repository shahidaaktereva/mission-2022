            <p>It is very important to have knowledge in different subjects to improve life. We need to have a lot of
                knowledge to improve our mindset. No matter how big we get in life, if we think that we know less than
                others, then we can gain a lot of knowledge. The moral of the story is that we should learn till the
                last day of life.</p> <br>
